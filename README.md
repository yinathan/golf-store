### Getting Started

[Click here](https://golf-store.herokuapp.com) to access the application. Click on clubs, balls, or accessories to view the full list of items currently stored in the database. If you wish to create a new item, click "Add New Item" button and fill out the form completely. Updating and deleting items can be done on the individual show pages.

### Future Enhancements

I hope to add authentication to only enable the user to edit, delete, or create new items if they are logged into an account.
